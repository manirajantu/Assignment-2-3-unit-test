/*
    In a typical API Application, there are usually request handling layer and service processing layer (followed by database layer which is omitted here).
    The functions defined in this JS file are simulation of those layers.

    handleRequest() should always handle request related matter, such as whether a request is valid.
    processRequest() should always handle process related matter, such as business logics and the data to return.

    Think about these questions:
    1. What do I test against for the respective function? (Defining testing objective)
    2. Do I have to mock any function or module?
    3. If the scope of my testing objective is too big, how can I break it down to smaller units?

    Read the comments of each function to understand the purpose of the function.
